# Dad bot

This is probably the most stupid idea I've had in a while.

When you start a message with _I'm_, _Im_ or _I am_, Dad will do a joke out of that.

### Run

Go to the Discord Developer Portal, create a new application and generate a token.

```sh
git clone https://github.com/ivaaane/dad.git
cd dad
echo "TOKEN={replace this with your token!}" > .env
pip install -r requirements.txt
python main.py
```
